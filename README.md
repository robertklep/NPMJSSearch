NPMJSSearch
===========

Makes searching search.npmjs.org from Chrome easier.

How?
----

Install this extension and open `http://search.npmjs.org/?q=YOUR+QUERY+HERE`

But how do I install this extension?
------------------------------------

* Download at least `main.js` and `manifest.json` and place them in
	a directory (perhaps called `NPMJSSearch`)
* Open the `Extensions` window in Chrome (`Window > Extensions` or
	Cmd-Shift-E on Mac)
* Enable `Developer Mode`
* Click the `Load unpacked extension...` button
* Point the file dialog towards the above created `NPMJSSearch` directory
* Try and see if it works: [perform a test query](http://search.npmjs.org/?q=chuck)

Tip
---

Create a search shortcut from so you can search from the omnibox! (also
know as 'the location bar'). You can add shortcuts in the Chrome
search engine settings window.
